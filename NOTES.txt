Model training for job matcher:
1. Problem restatement in your words

Input: A resume (free text).

Extracted features: Skills, job roles mentioned in the resume.

Output: A predicted job role (or set of possible roles) from a predefined list of real-world job roles stored in a database.

Essentially:
üëâ Resume text ‚Üí Extract structured features ‚Üí Match/ classify ‚Üí Retrieve standardized job role(s).

2. Core pipeline

This problem isn‚Äôt just Random Forest out-of-the-box. It needs a pipeline of NLP + ML + DB matching.

Step A: Data preparation

Collect a dataset of resumes (or synthetic resume-like entries). Each entry should have:

Text (skills, experiences, job titles).

Label = standardized job role (from your database).

Your database should contain a controlled list of job roles (e.g., ‚ÄúData Scientist‚Äù, ‚ÄúSoftware Engineer‚Äù, ‚ÄúProject Manager‚Äù, etc.).

Step B: Resume text preprocessing

Text cleaning: Lowercase, remove stopwords, punctuation.

Skill extraction: Use either

A predefined skills dictionary (e.g., NLP skills list: Python, SQL, Tableau, etc.), or

An NER model (Spacy, HuggingFace transformers trained on resumes).

Job role phrases: Extract titles like ‚ÄúSoftware Engineer‚Äù, ‚ÄúML Engineer‚Äù, etc. from past job experiences.

So after parsing, you get structured features like:

{
  "skills": ["python", "sql", "machine learning"],
  "mentioned_roles": ["data analyst", "intern"],
  "text": "full resume text..."
}

Step C: Feature representation

Convert extracted info into ML-friendly features:

Bag-of-Words / TF-IDF vectors on text.

Or use embeddings (e.g., sentence-BERT) for richer semantic meaning.

Optionally add binary features for skills (1 if present, 0 otherwise).

Step D: Model training (classification)

Now you can train a Random Forest Classifier:

Input: resume features (TF-IDF + skills indicators).

Target: standardized job role.

Random Forest is decent if your feature space is structured (skills, keywords).

If you only have text, Logistic Regression or Gradient Boosting / Transformer models often outperform RF on text classification.

Step E: Matching to database

After classification:

The predicted label is matched with your database of job roles.

If you want fuzzy matching (resume role text may not exactly match DB role), you can use:

Embedding similarity (cosine similarity between resume embedding & job role embedding).

Fuzzy string matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance).

3. Example workflow

Candidate uploads resume PDF.

Extract text ‚Üí parse skills & roles.

Vectorize ‚Üí pass into trained classifier.

Output predicted job role(s).

Query database: find best-matching standardized job title(s).

Return ranked list.

4. Implementation sketch (Python)

Here‚Äôs a simplified prototype with Random Forest:

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Example dataset: resumes + job role labels
df = pd.read_csv("resume_dataset.csv")  # columns: ["resume_text", "job_role"]

# Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    df["resume_text"], df["job_role"], test_size=0.2, stratify=df["job_role"], random_state=42
)

# Pipeline: TF-IDF + RandomForest
clf = Pipeline([
    ("tfidf", TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000, ngram_range=(1,2))),
    ("rf", RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=300, class_weight="balanced", random_state=42))
])

clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluation
pred = clf.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, pred))

# Predict new resume
new_resume = """Experienced in Python, SQL, and ML. Worked as a Data Analyst for 2 years."""
print("Predicted role:", clf.predict([new_resume])[0])


Then once you have the predicted role, you‚Äôd:

Match it with database:

SELECT * FROM job_roles WHERE role_name = <predicted_role>;


(or use fuzzy/embedding search if not exact).

5. Extra considerations

Database integration: Use embeddings (e.g., sentence-BERT) to store job role embeddings. Query resumes against them for semantic match.

Multi-label cases: One resume may map to multiple roles ‚Üí use RandomForestClassifier in multi-label mode (or OneVsRestClassifier).

Explainability: Use feature importances or SHAP to show which skills led to the prediction.

Scalability: Random Forest is fine for ~100k samples, but for millions of resumes, gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) or Transformer embeddings are better
